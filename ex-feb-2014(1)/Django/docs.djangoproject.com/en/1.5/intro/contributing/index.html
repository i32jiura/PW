<p>Interested in giving back to the community a little? Maybe you&#8217;ve found a bug
in Django that you&#8217;d like to see fixed, or maybe there&#8217;s a small feature you
want added.</p>
<p>Contributing back to Django itself is the best way to see your own concerns
addressed. This may seem daunting at first, but it&#8217;s really pretty simple.
We&#8217;ll walk you through the entire process, so you can learn by example.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-who-s-this-tutorial-for">

<p>For this tutorial, we expect that you have at least a basic understanding of
how Django works. This means you should be comfortable going through the
existing tutorials on <a class="reference internal" href="../tutorial01/index.html"><em>writing your first Django app</em></a>.
In addition, you should have a good understanding of Python itself. But if you
don&#8217;t, <a class="reference external" href="http://diveintopython.net/toc/index.html">Dive Into Python</a> is a fantastic (and free) online book for beginning
Python programmers.</p>
<p>Those of you who are unfamiliar with version control systems and Trac will find
that this tutorial and its links include just enough information to get started.
However, you&#8217;ll probably want to read some more about these different tools if
you plan on contributing to Django regularly.</p>
<p>For the most part though, this tutorial tries to explain as much as possible,
so that it can be of use to the widest audience.</p>
<div class="admonition-where-to-get-help admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Where to get help:</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be walking you through contributing a patch to Django for the first time.
By the end of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of both the
tools and the processes involved. Specifically, we&#8217;ll be covering the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Installing Git.</li>
<li>How to download a development copy of Django.</li>
<li>Running Django&#8217;s test suite.</li>
<li>Writing a test for your patch.</li>
<li>Writing the code for your patch.</li>
<li>Testing your patch.</li>
<li>Generating a patch file for your changes.</li>
<li>Where to look for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done with the tutorial, you can look through the rest of
<a class="reference internal" href="../../internals/contributing/index.html"><em>Django&#8217;s documentation on contributing</em></a>.
It contains lots of great information and is a must read for anyone who&#8217;d like
to become a regular contributor to Django. If you&#8217;ve got questions, it&#8217;s
probably got the answers.</p>

<div class="section" id="s-installing-git">
<span id="installing-git"></span><h2>Installing Git<a class="headerlink" href="index.html#installing-git" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For this tutorial, you&#8217;ll need Git installed to download the current
development version of Django and to generate patch files for the changes you
make.</p>
<p>To check whether or not you have Git installed, enter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> into the command
line. If you get messages saying that this command could be found, you&#8217;ll have
to download and install it, see <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/download">Git&#8217;s download page</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not that familiar with Git, you can always find out more about its
commands (once it&#8217;s installed) by typing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">help</span></tt> into the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version">
<span id="getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version"></span><h2>Getting a copy of Django&#8217;s development version<a class="headerlink" href="index.html#getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first step to contributing to Django is to get a copy of the source code.
From the command line, use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> command to navigate to the directory
where you&#8217;ll want your local copy of Django to live.</p>
<p>Download the Django source code repository using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>git clone https://github.com/django/django.git</pre>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For users who wish to use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualenv.org">virtualenv</a>, you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>pip install -e /path/to/your/local/clone/django/</pre>
</div>
<p class="last">(where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt> is the directory of your clone that contains
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></tt>) to link your cloned checkout into a virtual environment. This
is a great option to isolate your development copy of Django from the rest
of your system and avoids potential package conflicts.</p>

<div class="section" id="s-rolling-back-to-a-previous-revision-of-django">
<span id="rolling-back-to-a-previous-revision-of-django"></span><h2>Rolling back to a previous revision of Django<a class="headerlink" href="index.html#rolling-back-to-a-previous-revision-of-django" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For this tutorial, we&#8217;ll be using <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/17549">ticket #17549</a> as a case study, so we&#8217;ll
rewind Django&#8217;s version history in git to before that ticket&#8217;s patch was
applied. This will allow us to go through all of the steps involved in writing
that patch from scratch, including running Django&#8217;s test suite.</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that while we&#8217;ll be using an older revision of Django&#8217;s trunk
for the purposes of the tutorial below, you should always use the current
development revision of Django when working on your own patch for a ticket!</strong></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The patch for this ticket was written by Ulrich Petri, and it was applied
to Django as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/ac2052ebc84c45709ab5f0f25e685bf656ce79bc">commit ac2052ebc84c45709ab5f0f25e685bf656ce79bc</a>.
Consequently, we&#8217;ll be using the revision of Django just prior to that,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/39f5bc7fc3a4bb43ed8a1358b17fe0521a1a63ac">commit 39f5bc7fc3a4bb43ed8a1358b17fe0521a1a63ac</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Navigate into Django&#8217;s root directory (that&#8217;s the one that contains <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docs</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AUTHORS</span></tt>, etc.). You can then check out the older
revision of Django that we&#8217;ll be using in the tutorial below:</p>

<p>When contributing to Django it&#8217;s very important that your code changes don&#8217;t
introduce bugs into other areas of Django.  One way to check that Django still
works after you make your changes is by running Django&#8217;s test suite. If all
the tests still pass, then you can be reasonably sure that your changes
haven&#8217;t completely broken Django. If you&#8217;ve never run Django&#8217;s test suite
before, it&#8217;s a good idea to run it once beforehand just to get familiar with
what its output is supposed to look like.</p>
<p>We can run the test suite by simply <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt>-ing into the Django <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests/</span></tt>
directory and, if you&#8217;re using GNU/Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of
Unix, run:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite</pre>
</div>
<p>If you&#8217;re on Windows, the above should work provided that you are using
&#8220;Git Bash&#8221; provided by the default Git install. GitHub has a <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows">nice tutorial</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you&#8217;re using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></tt>, you can omit <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PYTHONPATH=..</span></tt> when running
the tests. This instructs Python to look for Django in the parent directory
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests</span></tt>. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></tt> puts your copy of Django on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PYTHONPATH</span></tt>
automatically.</p>
</div>
<p>Now sit back and relax. Django&#8217;s entire test suite has over 4800 different
tests, so it can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to run, depending on the
speed of your computer.</p>
<p>While Django&#8217;s test suite is running, you&#8217;ll see a stream of characters
representing the status of each test as it&#8217;s run. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">E</span></tt> indicates that an error
was raised during a test, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">F</span></tt> indicates that a test&#8217;s assertions failed.
Both of these are considered to be test failures. Meanwhile, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">s</span></tt>
indicated expected failures and skipped tests, respectively. Dots indicate
passing tests.</p>
<p>Skipped tests are typically due to missing external libraries required to run
the test; see <a class="reference internal" href="../../internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/index.html#running-unit-tests-dependencies"><em>Running all the tests</em></a> for a list of dependencies
and be sure to install any for tests related to the changes you are making (we
won&#8217;t need any for this tutorial).</p>
<p>Once the tests complete, you should be greeted with a message informing you
whether the test suite passed or failed. Since you haven&#8217;t yet made any changes
to Django&#8217;s code, the entire test suite <strong>should</strong> pass. If you get failures or
errors make sure you&#8217;ve followed all of the previous steps properly. See
<a class="reference internal" href="../../internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/index.html#running-unit-tests"><em>Running the unit tests</em></a> for more information.</p>
<p>Note that the latest Django trunk may not always be stable. When developing
against trunk, you can check <a class="reference external" href="http://ci.djangoproject.com/">Django&#8217;s continuous integration builds</a> to
determine if the failures are specific to your machine or if they are also
present in Django&#8217;s official builds. If you click to view a particular build,
you can view the &#8220;Configuration Matrix&#8221; which shows failures broken down by
Python version and database backend.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">For this tutorial and the ticket we&#8217;re working on, testing against SQLite
is sufficient, however, it&#8217;s possible (and sometimes necessary) to

<p>In most cases, for a patch to be accepted into Django it has to include tests.
For bug fix patches, this means writing a regression test to ensure that the
bug is never reintroduced into Django later on. A regression test should be
written in such a way that it will fail while the bug still exists and pass
once the bug has been fixed. For patches containing new features, you&#8217;ll need
to include tests which ensure that the new features are working correctly.
They too should fail when the new feature is not present, and then pass once it
has been implemented.</p>
<p>A good way to do this is to write your new tests first, before making any
changes to the code. This style of development is called
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a> and can be applied to both entire projects and
single patches. After writing your tests, you then run them to make sure that
they do indeed fail (since you haven&#8217;t fixed that bug or added that feature
yet). If your new tests don&#8217;t fail, you&#8217;ll need to fix them so that they do.
After all, a regression test that passes regardless of whether a bug is present
is not very helpful at preventing that bug from reoccurring down the road.</p>
<p>Now for our hands-on example.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-writing-some-tests-for-ticket-17549">

<div>It&#8217;s useful for URLField to give you a way to open the URL; otherwise you
might as well use a CharField.</div></blockquote>
<p>In order to resolve this ticket, we&#8217;ll add a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">render</span></tt> method to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AdminURLFieldWidget</span></tt> in order to display a clickable link above the input
widget. Before we make those changes though, we&#8217;re going to write a couple
tests to verify that our modification functions correctly and continues to
function correctly in the future.</p>

<p>The new tests check to see that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">render</span></tt> method we&#8217;ll be adding works
correctly in a couple different situations.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">But this testing thing looks kinda hard...</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never had to deal with tests before, they can look a little hard
to write at first glance. Fortunately, testing is a <em>very</em> big subject in
computer programming, so there&#8217;s lots of information out there:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>A good first look at writing tests for Django can be found in the
documentation on <a class="reference internal" href="../../topics/testing/overview.1"><em>Testing Django applications</em></a>.</li>
<li>Dive Into Python (a free online book for beginning Python developers)
includes a great <a class="reference external" href="http://diveintopython.net/unit_testing/index.html">introduction to Unit Testing</a>.</li>
<li>After reading those, if you want something a little meatier to sink
your teeth into, there&#8217;s always the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html">Python unittest documentation</a>.</li>

<p>Remember that we haven&#8217;t actually made any modifications to

tests in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">model_forms_regress</span></tt> folder to make sure that&#8217;s really what
happens. From the command line, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> into the Django <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests/</span></tt> directory

<p>If the tests ran correctly, you should see three failures corresponding to each

<p>Once you&#8217;re done modifying Django, we need to make sure that the tests we wrote
earlier pass, so we can see whether the code we wrote above is working
correctly. To run the tests in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">admin_widgets</span></tt> folder, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> into the
Django <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tests/</span></tt> directory and run:</p>

the following exception:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>NameError: global name 'smart_urlquote' is not defined</pre>
</div>
<p>We forgot to add the import for that method.  Go ahead and add the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">smart_urlquote</span></tt> import at the end of line 13 of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django/contrib/admin/widgets.py</span></tt> so it looks as follows:</p>

<p>Re-run the tests and everything should pass. If it doesn&#8217;t, make sure you

<p>Once you&#8217;ve verified that your patch and your test are working correctly, it&#8217;s
a good idea to run the entire Django test suite just to verify that your change
hasn&#8217;t introduced any bugs into other areas of Django. While successfully
passing the entire test suite doesn&#8217;t guarantee your code is bug free, it does
help identify many bugs and regressions that might otherwise go unnoticed.</p>

command to save the patch file to your current working directory:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>git diff &gt; 17549.diff</pre>

<p>Congratulations, you&#8217;ve generated your very first Django patch! Now that you&#8217;ve
got that under your belt, you can put those skills to good use by helping to
improve Django&#8217;s codebase. Generating patches and attaching them to Trac
tickets is useful, however, since we are using git - adopting a more <a class="reference internal" href="../../internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git/index.html"><em>git
oriented workflow</em></a> is
recommended.</p>
<p>Since we never committed our changes locally, perform the following to get your

information on contributing that you should probably take a look at:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You should make sure to read Django&#8217;s documentation on
<a class="reference internal" href="../../internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/index.html"><em>claiming tickets and submitting patches</em></a>.
It covers Trac etiquette, how to claim tickets for yourself, expected

<li>First time contributors should also read Django&#8217;s <a class="reference internal" href="../../internals/contributing/new-contributors/index.html"><em>documentation
for first time contributors</em></a>.
It has lots of good advice for those of us who are new to helping out
with Django.</li>

contributing, you can always browse through the rest of

simpler in nature and are great for first time contributors.  Once you&#8217;re
familiar with contributing to Django, you can move on to writing patches for
more difficult and complicated tickets.</p>
<p>If you just want to get started already (and nobody would blame you!), try
taking a look at the list of <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;has_patch=0&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets that need patches</a> and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;needs_better_patch=1&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets that have patches which need improvement</a>. If you&#8217;re familiar
with writing tests, you can also look at the list of
<a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;needs_tests=1&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets that need tests</a>. Just remember to follow the guidelines about
claiming tickets that were mentioned in the link to Django&#8217;s documentation on
<a class="reference internal" href="../../internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/index.html"><em>claiming tickets and submitting patches</em></a>.</p>

<span id="what-s-next"></span><h3>What&#8217;s next?<a class="headerlink" href="index.html#what-s-next" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After a ticket has a patch, it needs to be reviewed by a second set of eyes.
After uploading a patch or submitting a pull request, be sure to update the
ticket metadata by setting the flags on the ticket to say &#8220;has patch&#8221;,
&#8220;doesn&#8217;t need tests&#8221;, etc, so others can find it for review. Contributing
doesn&#8217;t necessarily always mean writing a patch from scratch. Reviewing
existing patches is also a very helpful contribution. See
<a class="reference internal" href="../../internals/contributing/triaging-tickets/index.html"><em>Triaging tickets</em></a> for details.</p>
